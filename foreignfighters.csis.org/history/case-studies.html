                      <p>The Islamic State group has mobilized tens of thousands of individuals from over 120 countries to fight in Iraq and Syria on behalf of the organization.<sup>1</sup> Although the scope and scale of the (mostly) Islamic State-inspired migration is unprecedented, the foreign fighter phenomenon has shaped military conflicts in recent history. As the Islamic State continues to shrink, and sheds fighters who joined the battle from abroad, lessons from previous conflicts featuring foreign fighters may be illustrative.</p>

<p>The “anti-Soviet Jihad” in Afghanistan in the 1980s was the first modern conflict to see high levels of foreign fighter participation. From that conflict, a global militant community established the funding networks, credibility, and battlefield proficiency operationalized in Bosnia and Chechnya a decade later.</p>

<p>These conflicts follow similar patterns: conflict-induced humanitarian crises eventually precipitate supranational struggles drawing worldwide volunteers. After September 11, 2001, subsequent foreign fighter mobilizations evolve in how fighters migrate, fight, and communicate, but maintain the basic commonalities that shaped the first conflicts. The personal networks built in Afghanistan strengthened in Bosnia and Chechnya and were critical to shaping the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. Returning fighters from previous conflicts moved on to found many of the terror networks that gave rise to current jihadi-salafi organizations such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State.</p>

<blockquote>Conflict-induced humanitarian crises eventually precipitate supranational struggles drawing worldwide volunteers.</blockquote>

<p>Despite differences in space and time, common themes link each successive jihad. Each conflict was considered a defensive war on behalf of a local Muslim population, which enabled international supporters (both donors and fighters) to frame participation in the conflict as a religious duty. These conflicts were further linked by a common group of fighters who gained credibility and combat experience ultimately culminating in improved military effectiveness. As technology evolved, so too did the foreign fighters, and each conflict pioneered new approaches to waging “jihad through the media.” <sup>2</sup> Media outreach began with Afghanistan in the 1980s with flyers and newsletters for propaganda purposes, while today’s international militants broadcast their battles using video cameras and curated social media strategies. The fighters’ force-multiplying potential and military experience allowed them to change the nature of conflicts from national to supranational by situating local grievances within a pan-Islamic jihadist narrative. <sup> 3 </sup> </p>

    <li style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;margin-top:0px;color:#fff;line-height: 34px;">The evolution of volunteers from international humanitarian workers to fighters helped establish the credibility and militant networks that would drive future conflicts.</li>
</ul>
</span></p> </div>

<p>In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to defend its communist proxy government in Kabul from a growing insurgency. Almost immediately, <em>madrassas</em> (religious schools) in Pakistan began a campaign to encourage foreigners to travel to Afghanistan to join the jihad.</p>

<p>At first, many of the Arab volunteers who traveled to Afghanistan with the help of Hijaz-based Islamic charities<sup>4</sup> viewed themselves as humanitarian workers.<sup>5</sup> These largely Arab volunteers sought to keep a low profile and to help Afghan refugees who were residing in Peshawar, Pakistan, after fleeing the conflict. In contrast, volunteers arriving during the latter half of the war were fighters facilitated by Abdullah Azzam, an influential Palestinian sheikh who called upon all Muslims to defend Afghanistan. </p>

<p>As the Soviet invasion turned into a prolonged occupation, Peshawar became a hub for fighters to organize and mobilize across the border into Afghanistan. Facilitators like Azzam, who was publishing recruitment literature and teaching in Islamabad, relocated to Peshawar to assist.<sup>6</sup>  Azzam’s extensive paramilitary experience and networks from his Islamic education in Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia gave him the ideological and operational clout to effectively mobilize foreign fighters against the Soviets.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>In 1985, Azzam reached an agreement with a local guerrilla coalition called the Islamic Unity of Mujahedeen allowing him to establish training camps and an office focused on facilitating the flow of fighters to the war.<sup>8</sup> Azzam continued to call on Muslims to defend their brothers and sisters, declaring that it was “incumbent upon every Muslim today, capable of carrying a weapon, to march forward to jihad to aid their Muslim brothers in Afghanistan.”<sup>9</sup> Among the individuals who joined the fighters in Peshawar was a young Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden’s personal wealth, connections to other funding networks, and friendship with Azzam allowed him to facilitate training and travel for the fighters.</p>

<p>Geopolitical competition also played a role in mobilizing fighters. The invasion, and subsequent occupation, of Afghanistan prompted the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan to counter Moscow’s presence in the so-called “shatter-zone” <sup>10</sup> by supporting local Afghan insurgents and their foreign volunteers.<sup>11</sup> Rather than initiate a full-scale war with the Soviet Union, the United States, through the CIA, alongside Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Agency (ISI), provided the local (mainly ethnic Pashtun) fighters with weapons, funding, and military training to combat the Soviet army.<sup>12</sup> The newly empowered mujahedeen fighters drew on a pool of volunteer jihadists reaching far beyond the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan in their fight against the Soviets.<sup>13</sup></p>

<p>Azzam’s grassroots efforts and abundant war materiel attracted foreign fighters from the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, Europe, and the United States to wage war against the infidels (nonbelievers) occupying Afghanistan.<sup>14</sup> There is no consensus as to how many people traveled to Afghanistan, but estimates range from 10,000 to 35,000.<sup>15</sup> Those who did travel to the battle were largely supported by private donations or nongovernmental Islamic organizations.<sup>16</sup> Despite mistrust and enmity among the “Afghan Arabs”<sup>17</sup> and friction between the foreigners and their local hosts, the volunteers’ international connections helped them establish patronage networks and strong interpersonal bonds.</p>

<p>The departure of Soviet troops in February 1989 removed the raison d’être for many of the foreigners. Some fighters returned to their countries of origin, where they either demobilized or joined local causes. A further cohort attempted to follow Abdullah Azzam’s vision of a vanguard that would “continue the jihad no matter how long the way is until the last breath and the last beating of the pulse or we see the Islamic state established.”<sup>18</sup> Osama bin Laden and Abdullah Azzam founded Maktab al Khidamat (MAK, or “Bureau of Services”), which was subsumed into al Qaeda in 1988 and facilitated ongoing operations.<sup>19</sup> Despite a limited military impact in Afghanistan, the battlefield skills and personal relationships fighters established provided credibility and the networks carried forward to other conflicts—including to that underway in Bosnia.</p>

  <li style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;margin-top:0px;color:#fff;line-height: 34px;">Migrating fighters from Afghanistan brought funding networks, credibility, and military experience to the conflict.</li>
    <li style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;margin-top:0px;color:#fff;line-height: 34px;">The influx of foreign fighters shifted the conflict from a national struggle to a supranational jihad.</li>
    <li style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;margin-top:0px;color:#fff;line-height: 34px;">Foreign fighters began filming and distributing videos and using media more extensively as a recruiting tool.</li>
</ul>
</span></p> </div>


<p>In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent disintegration of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the Balkans provided fertile ground for foreign fighters to continue fighting. Increased nationalist sentiment among Catholic Croats, Orthodox Christian Serbs, and mostly Muslim Bosniaks culminated in a wave of declarations of independence. Influenced by Slovenia and Croatia, which both declared independence in June 1991, Bosnia-Herzegovina declared independence in March 1992. Bosnian Serbs refused to accept separation from Serbia and, backed by the Serbian military, took up arms against the Bosnian Muslims.<sup>20</sup> The overt religious nature of the war, atrocities committed against civilians, and the timing of hostilities made the conflict attractive for the former mujahedeen coming from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The first Afghan Arabs arrived in Bosnia in April 1992, one month after the war in Bosnia began. The initial movement of fighters began slowly with the transfer of trainers and facilitators from Afghanistan under the guise of humanitarian assistance. However, it quickly increased in 1993 when the Pakistani government ordered training camps closed and threatened those remaining foreigners with deportation.<sup>21</sup> One commander and associate of Osama bin Laden who fought in Afghanistan and arrived in Bosnia in April 1992, Sheikh Abu Abdel Aziz “Barbaros,” quickly established the El Mudžahid Battalion and began moving fighters from Peshawar to Bosnia.</p>

<p>As in Afghanistan, Muslim charities financed the movement of foreigners to Bosnia. The Al Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn, New York, raised funds in the United States for organizations led by bin Laden and Azzam during the Afghan war, and soon redirected its activities to Bosnia. Al Kifah and, later, the Benevolence International Foundation (BIF), led by Enaam Arnaout, an associate of Osama bin Laden, operated openly in the West.<sup>22</sup> Both organizations purported to raise money for humanitarian operations but instead laundered funds and directed money to arms trafficking and moved fighters to the conflict. The Maktab al-Khidamat (MAK) distributed leaflets in the United States encouraging those sympathetic to the plight of Bosnian Muslims to support the jihad through donations or by traveling to the conflict themselves. As in Afghanistan, groups supporting foreign fighters blurred the lines between humanitarian and military aid to garner support in a more socially acceptable way.</p>

<p>Instructors who came to Bosnia from the Peshawar camps created military-religious training facilities for Bosnian soldiers and fighters who had little combat experience or religious education. Thus, Bosnian Muslims came to identify with the greater Muslim world while building combat experience. In addition to involving Afghanistan war veterans, the conflict in Bosnia attracted new recruits as well. The Serbian military’s ethnic cleansing pushed young, untrained individuals to view Bosnia, according to journalist Chris Hedges, as “a Muslim country, which must be defended by Muslims.”<sup>23</sup> Young foreign fighters who joined the war gained credibility, connections, and experience similar to those who fought in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>There is no agreement on the numbers of foreign fighters who traveled to Bosnia. Figures range from 500–5,000 with a preponderance of estimates in the 1,000–2,000 range. <sup>24</sup> Influential clerics from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen endorsed the jihad in Bosnia and fighters traveled from their countries to fight.<sup>25</sup> Others came from the United States, Turkey, Iran, Jordan, and Syria, among other states. The multinational nature of the fighters and their unifying Muslim identity helped forge a new sense of religious identity and unity for the Bosnian Muslims with whom they fought alongside.<sup>26</sup></p>

<p>In an evolution from the war in Afghanistan, those fighting in Bosnia often filmed their military maneuvers and distributed videos on the nascent Internet. The use of media in the form of both sympathetic reporters and battlefield recordings represented an important enhancement for the global jihadi movement’s messaging efforts.</p>

<p>The signing of the Dayton Peace Accords in December 1995 effectively ended the combat role of foreign fighters in Bosnia. The Dayton Accords required all forces “not of local origin” to withdraw from the country within 30 days.<sup>27</sup> Despite the relative relief that the end of the war would bring to Muslim civilians in Bosnia, many of the fighters were upset at the peace because it not only ended the war but also robbed them of the opportunity to become martyrs.<sup>28</sup> However, the end of the Bosnian conflict resulted in a quick shift of fighters from the Balkans to the North Caucasus with another chance to fight for their cause.</p>

<ul>

  <li style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;margin-top:0px;color:#fff;line-height: 34px;">A local struggle for autonomy was co-opted by an interconnected, well-financed, and growing group of mobile violent extremists.</li>

</ul>
</span></p> </div>

<p>In the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse, the Caucasus, like the Balkans, experienced political unrest as nationalist groups demanded autonomy. As the conflict in the Balkans ended, an ethno-religious struggle between Chechnya and Russia escalated. Chechnya was the only one of the Russian republics that refused to sign an understanding regarding its relationship with Russia. A Russian Air Force general, Dzhokhar Dudayev, was elected the head of the All-National Congress of the Chechen people in 1990; shortly thereafter Dudayev unilaterally declared the independent Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Russia attempted to overthrow Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev but was ultimately unsuccessful.<sup>29</sup> Chechnya was divided along various lines and loyalties but Dudayev, campaigning on a platform of independence, won the 1991 elections with 90 percent of the vote.<sup>30</sup></p>

<p>Repeated attempts to reach an agreement between Russia and Chechnya regarding Chechnya’s status failed, and Russia moved troops to the Chechen border in October of 1992. Amid the instability, Sheikh Ali Fathi al Shisani, a Jordanian-Chechen and veteran of the Soviet Afghan War, moved to Chechnya in 1993. Sheikh Fathi became largely responsible for mobilizing foreign fighters to the republic.</p>

<p>Russian civilian leadership, working under the assumption that victory could be achieved quickly, ordered its forces into Chechnya on December 10, 1994. Outnumbered, the Chechen forces adopted guerrilla tactics to combat the Russian military. The Chechen style of warfare exacerbated long-standing issues in the Russian military like low morale, poor supplies, and ineffective leadership—and eventually helped Chechen forces stave off a complete rout.</p>

<p>The invading Russian forces burned villages to the ground, raped local women, and killed thousands of civilians during the initial assault. Like in Afghanistan and Bosnia, the invading force’s brutal tactics, in concert with the clear delineation between the Muslim population and the opposing power, galvanized the population and served as a catalyst for militant recruitment.<sup>31</sup></p>

<p>Chechen historical resistance to the Russians was placed squarely within the canon of global jihad and the struggle quickly became gazavat or jihad.<sup>32</sup> The Chief Mufti of Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov, declared the responsibility of Muslims to wage holy war against Russia and a Chechen commander, Shamil Basayev, began working with fighters arriving from abroad.</p>

<p>Using his connections to recruit in Afghanistan, Sheikh Fathi began facilitating the transport of fighters, among them prominent Saudi Arabian fighter Samir Salih Abdallah al Suwaylim who went by the <em>nom de guerre</em> Emir Khattab.<sup>33</sup> Khattab believed Chechnya was ripe for jihad, and capitalized on his reputation as an experienced fighter and respected leader to establish a foreign fighter unit among the Chechen rebels.</p>

<p>Working initially under Shamil Basayev, Khattab observed local customs and treated traditions with respect. This approach, along with the sponsorship of Basayev, enabled him to establish credibility and acceptance among the nationalist Chechens.<sup>34</sup> As important to his success was Khattab’s understanding of the power of media on a potential jihadi recruit. In a later interview, Khattab reflected that “in the modern age, the media has become more important than rifles and guns.”<sup>35</sup> Khattab required all operations to be filmed and distributed, pioneering a critical form of jihadi media and propaganda. Emulating Abdullah Azzam’s recruiting role from Afghanistan, Khattab directed media to a website called “Jihad in Chechnya,” published by Azzam Publications.</p>

<p>Unlike Afghanistan and, to a lesser extent Bosnia, Chechnya did not draw thousands of foreign volunteers. The difficulty of travel to Chechnya prevented the movement of larger numbers of fighters, including figures such as bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, from joining the conflict. In 1997, Zawahiri attempted to travel to Chechnya but was stopped in his attempt by Russian security forces, which imprisoned him for six months in Dagestan. In the wake of his attempt to join fighters in Chechnya, in 2001 Ayman al Zawahiri advocated for others to travel so that Chechnya would serve as a “hotbed of jihad (or fundamentalism as the United States describes it) and that the region would become the shelter of thousands of Muslim mujahedeen from various parts of the Islamic world.”</p>

Significant discrepancies in foreign fighter numbers result from the complexity of counting and tracking the flow of fighters into Syria, Iraq, and Libya. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies, the United Nations, and other entities monitoring foreign fighters are unable to provide wholly accurate information on what was believed to be 38,500 fighters from 120 nations by the time foreign fighter flows began to slow in 2016. “Remarks by Lisa O.

  <p style="margin:20px;text-align:inherit;">5. A network of Islamic charities based in the Hijaz region of Saudi Arabia was established by the Saudis in the 1980s to fund the Afghan mujahedeen. The elaborate network of donors, charities, and sponsors has since become a pipeline for terrorist group financing in conflicts from Chechnya to Palestine.
